<p>As principal of East West College of Engineering, it gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the digital platform of our college. As you browse through our site you will get an idea of our college's strong thinking inherited from our founder, Honourable Ex-Mayor of Bangalore Late. Sri. C. M. Nagaraj, and his vision 'social transformation through dynamic education', since 1968. The accomplishments of our founder chairman are continued by our present chairman Sri. C. N. Ravikiran, an educationist and social worker in establishing this college in the year 2015.


The main focus of the Institution is to empower the students with sound knowledge, wisdom, experience, and training both at the academic level of engineering and in the highly competitive global industrial market. We are fortunate to have a talented, highly committed teaching and support staff, to ensure the learning environment of our students is at the best. To make the engineering education agile, in order to respond instantly to the changes in science and technology, Industry interaction and Industrial visits are taken up regularly. Additionally, guest lecturers from various industrial backgrounds and from premier institutes are invited to the institute. During teaching-learning process group discussions, problem posing, problem-solving, and experimental learning are involved in the institute. Apart from teaching, the teachers are also the mentors, advisors, guides for the ideas and challenges of the students. Our motto is, "to create better human beings‚Äù. We can do that, only when we implant in our students the values which are necessary for life. We aim to provide an overall development that nurtures them towards becoming strong and focused human beings. Soft skills and educational skills are what the institution seeks to provide every student at the campus. My entire team and I welcome your input and appreciate your support and commitment to providing the best educational experience to our students.</p>

<p>I look forward to knowing more about you at EWCE!</p>
